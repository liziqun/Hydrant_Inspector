# Hydrant_Inspector

https://liziqun.github.io/Hydrant_Inspector/

This is an application intended for the Philadelphia Fire Department to conduct their hydrant inspections. The prioritization scores were generated using machine learning methods (to predict fire risk) and normalized summations of other scores. This project was done as part of the University of Pennsylvania MUSA 800 course and the application was also submitted for the MUSA 611 final project.

## App functionality
- Allows the user to select the factors they want to generate a new map of ranked scores.
- Allows the user to select if they would like to view engines or hydrants or both.
- Allows the user to turn on and off the engine borders.
- Allows the user to vary the opacity of the different map layers. This selected opacity remains fixed even if the user updates the map.
- The map resets to the original position, opacities and blank colour when pressing reset. Positions and labels on the respective sliders are also pushed back to the original position.
- Tooltips over both the engines and the hydrants to show individual information.
- Links for report available on the website.
